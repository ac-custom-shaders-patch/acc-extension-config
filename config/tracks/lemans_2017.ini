; I recommend to avoid using IGNORE_SHARED_THRESHOLD, because this option can really affect the performance 
; as well as look in a negative way. However, in some very rare cases, it might be appropriate. Here, I used 
; it to add a bit of blue light in fog for that colorfully backlit milky fog look. It appears that those meshes 
; are rare so it shouldnâ€™t be a problem.
