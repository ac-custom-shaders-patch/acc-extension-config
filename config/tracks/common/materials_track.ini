[TEMPLATE: Material_DistantEmissive]
UseAlpha = 0                ; set to 1 if you’re replacing ksPerPixelAlpha, so alpha property would be used

; Alternative for MultiMap shader with displacement map, stored in alpha-channel of “txNormal”,
; could work either in parallax or tesselation mode depending on settings.
[TEMPLATE: Material_DisplacementMap]
UseTessellation = 0     ; use tessellation shader (requires specially prepared mesh; don’t forget to make sure it would work 
                        ; without that option since some people won’t be using tessellation)
UseParallaxShadows = 0  ; use parallax shadows (slower)

DisplacementDistanceFar = 40.0  ; how far displacement is calculated
DisplacementDistanceNear = 0.5  ; at what distance displacement starts to fade out
DisplacementScale = 1.0         ; scale for displacement
DisplacementOcclusion = 0.2     ; how dark are deepest parts

; Only for ksPerPixel, ksPerPixelAT, ksPerPixelNM, ksMultilayer and ksMultilayer_fresnel_nm! 
; “Squashes” geometry to make sure it won’t clip against far clip plane. Doesn’t affect fog, lighting and other visual aspects, 
; only makes sure to fit mesh in view frustum.
; Warning: highly experimental for now. I’m not sure there won’t be some nasty side effects. Haven’t noticed anything yet though.
[TEMPLATE: Material_DistantGeometry]
DistantCompressionStart = 2000  ; starts squishing after this distance
DistantCompressionRate = 100    ; squishing rate: compresses stuff along view direction in this number of times
RemoveLODOut = 0                ; set to 1 to disable distant LOD hiding for those meshes

; Alternative for ksMultiMap/ksMultiMap_emissive, for windows, adding a bit of insides in
; the style of Watch Dogs
[TEMPLATE: Material_RoomWindows EXTENDS _Base_Material_Custom]

; Start by setting DebugMode to 1, and deciding on EmissiveMode
DebugMode = 0                   ; mark some special areas for easier positioning
EmissiveMode = DIFFUSE_TEXTURE  ; valid values: DIFFUSE_TEXTURE, DIFFUSE_WITH_EMISSIVE, DIFFUSE_EMISSIVE_BLEND, ONE
  ; DIFFUSE_TEXTURE: emissive = ksEmissive × txDiffuse
  ; DIFFUSE_WITH_EMISSIVE: emissive = ksEmissive × txDiffuse × txEmissive
  ; DIFFUSE_EMISSIVE_BLEND: emissive = ksEmissive × (txDiffuse × (1 - txEmissive.alpha) + txEmissive × txEmissive.alpha)
  ; ONE: emissive = ksEmissive

; After that, decide how to bind floors to model. You can either define them in world-space, for the whole model:
RoomHeight = 3.0          ; with DebugMode, it’s easy to find a good height; notice that ceiling is at the upper edge of red line
RoomVerticalOffset = 3.0  ; changing height would mess up vertical offset, so set it second, that’s the nature of world-space

; Or, you can bind them to texture coordinates, if window texture is nicely repeated all over the place:
SnapToTexCoords = 0        ; for that, change this flag to 1
TexCoordsSnapScale = 1.0   ; how many repeats will make a floor? set this value here
TexCoordsSnapOffset = 0.0  ; offset for texture coordinates snapping

; Once floors are set, you can align them nicely:
RoomCeilingRotation = 0.0  ; rotate ceiling to align it with the building
RoomCeilingScale = 1, 1    ; if needed, you can scale ceiling
RoomCeilingOffset = 0, 0   ; and add some offset so lamps would align nicely with windows

; If you got here, most difficult part is complete. Now, let’s adjust shape if needed (or, skip this step):
Shape1_X_W = 0.14      ; size of a lamp in X axis (in ceiling coordinates)
Shape1_Y_W = 0.6       ; size of a lamp in Y axis 
Shape2_X_W = 0.02      ; size of separator in X axis
Shape2_X_Mult = -0.05  ; effect of separator in X axis (set to 0 to disable)
Shape2_Y_W = 0.02      ; size of separator in Y axis
Shape2_Y_Mult = 0.0    ; effect of separator in Y axis (set to 0 to disable)
ShapeSmoothness = 0.0  ; smoothness/bubbiness of resulting shape, from 0.0 to 1.0
                       ; if you want to get a round lamp, set size to 0 and smoothness to 0.7…1.0
ShapeChance = 0.8      ; chance of lamp appearing in a slot

; After shape is ready, we can adjust brightness, but first, a few preparations (changing those settings
; might invalidate brightness)
NormalsFactor = 0.9        ; with 0, interior is seen everywhere; increase to occlude interior at glazing angles
                           ; usually, 0.8 should work great, but if normals are messed up, change to 0
EmissiveDiffuseMult = 1.0  ; multiplier for txDiffuse for emissiveness (if used in EmissiveMode); will be clipped to 1
EmissiveDiffuseEXP = 0.0   ; if non-zero, txDiffuse will be desaturated. set to more than zero to make dark areas 
                           ; of txDiffuse hide interior better

; And here are brightness parameters:
InteriorMult = 1.0                     ; general brightness multiplier for interior lighting
InteriorBaseBrightness = 0.5           ; constant background brightness for interior
InteriorVolumeBrightness = 1.5         ; brightness of volumetric light inside, changing with view angle
InteriorLightsBrightness = 1.0         ; brightness of actual lights, multiplier
InteriorGlowBrightness = 1.0           ; and multiplier for glow effect for those lights
InteriorVolumeAmbientBrightness = 1.0  ; brightness of volumetric light during the day, depends on ambient

; After everything else is done, you can adjust depth and clipping near windows:
RoomDepth = 3.0              ; in meters, usually 3.0 is enough for small buildings, but thicker ones might need values up to 10
RoomNearEdgeClipping = -1.0  ; coefficient for clipping near windows, set to -1.0 to disable that clipping
