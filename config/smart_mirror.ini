SHORT_DESCRIPTION=Real reflections and more

[BASIC]
; Extension and view alteration settings (view alteration is a simple reflection view point skew, doesn’t affect performance and makes reflections a bit more live, but overall not that great)
ENABLED=1 ; Active (set to 0 to disable Smart Mirror extension); 1 or 0
ACTIVE_ON_FOCUSED=1 ; Enable mirrors if car is focused (not only in first person view); 1 or 0
DISTANCE_MULT=20, 20 ; Distance multiplier
K_MULT=1.4, 0.7 ; Coefficient multiplier
ANGLE_MULT=0.1, -0.1 ; Angle multiplier

[VR]
; View alteration settings for VR
DISTANCE_MULT=20, 20 ; Distance multiplier
K_MULT=1.0, 0.5 ; Coefficient multiplier
ANGLE_MULT=0.1, -0.1 ; Angle multiplier

[REAL_MIRRORS]
; Real Mirrors (proper, accurate reflections, with separate textures for different mirrors, could be quite costly)
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0

VR_LOCK=0 ; VR lock; 1 or 0
SHOW_HEAD=0 ; Show driver head in reflections; 1 or 0
RENDER_PER_FRAME=0 ; Refresh rate per frame (set it to 1 to make real mirrors refresh less frequent, but have practically zero FPS cost); update everything is 0, update single reflection per frame is 1, update two reflections per frame is 2, update three reflections per frame is 3
RENDER_ONLY_VISIBLE=1 ; Render only visible mirrors (doesn’t work with virtual mirror at the moment); 1 or 0
