[ADVANCED_GAMEPADS]
; PS4 DualShock, PS5 DualSense and Nintendo controllers integration
ENABLED=1 ; Active (Lua scripts can redefine the way light bar and LEDs work even with this option disabled); 1 or 0
BLOCK_STEAM=1 ; Block Steam integration (try to block Steam Input turning complex controllers into simple Xbox-compatible ones, alternatively disable Steam Input in Assetto Corsa settings in Steam); 1 or 0
AUTODETECT=1 ; Detect PS5 DualSense automatically (if active with gamepad controller mode, but without DualSense controllers, loading might be slower. If not active, you need to switch to DualSense controller type in controller settings in CM.); 1 or 0
AUTODETECT_DUALSHOCK=1 ; Detect other custom gamepads automatically (if active with gamepad controller mode, but without DualSense controllers, loading might be slower. If not active, you need to switch to DualSense controller type in controller settings in CM.); 1 or 0
SHIFTING_COLORS=SMOOTH ; Light bar shifting color; Smooth is SMOOTH, Discrete is DISCRETE, Disabled is 0

MOUSE_PAD=1 ; Use pad to control mouse (Lua scripts can redefine pad use); 1 or 0
LOW_BATTERY_WARNING=1 ; Show low battery warning in the top left corner; 1 or 0
__HINT_BOTTOM=For advanced features make sure to disable Steam Input option for Assetto Corsa in Steam (although “Block Steam integration” option might help as well).

__HINT_BOTTOM=Only works when plugged with a USB cable. Also, currently, might not work as expected if more than one DualSense gamepad is connected.
