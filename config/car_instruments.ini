FULLNAME=Car instruments
PREVIEW=https://acstuff.ru/images/modules/car_instruments.jpg
DESCRIPTION=A bunch of new features for cars. Unfortunately, things like reverse lights or turn signals, require separate meshes, but patch allows to inject and replace meshes in KN5 files, so there is no need to ship 40+ MB replacements.
SHORT_DESCRIPTION=More features for cars
