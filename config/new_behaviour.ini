FULLNAME=New AI behavior
PREVIEW=https://acstuff.ru/images/modules/new_behaviour.jpg
DESCRIPTION=Adds new AI behavior in track mode, creating seemingly endless traffic, and allows to drive wrong way in practice or track day. Doesn’t affect online races.
SHORT_DESCRIPTION=AI flood

[BASIC]
; Extension
ENABLED=1 ; Active (set to 0 to disable new behavior extension); 1 or 0

[AI_TWEAKS]
; AI tweaks
FIX_SHORT_AXLE=1 ; Better three-wheelers support (if three-wheeler is set with a short rear axle, AIs become overly cautios. This tweak fixes that.); 1 or 0
FIX_SHORT_AXLE_TRACK=0.25 ;; hidden
FIX_LOW_LEVEL=1 ; Fix low strengths (without this option AIs might have a hard time shifting gears with AI strength below 80%); 1 or 0; new
START_REDUCE_REDLINING=1 ; Prevent AIs from redlining before the start (experimental feature); 1 or 0
START_STRAIGHTEN_TRAJECTORY=1 ; Straighten AIs trajectory when starting (experimental feature); 1 or 0
ACT_IMPATIENT=1 ; Act impatient if blocked; 1 or 0
TRAJECTORIES_FOR_DUMMIES=1 ; Use simpler AI spline for low-level AIs (switch to AI splines further from ideal for bots with level below 90%); 1 or 0
CAUTIOUS_STEERING=1 ; Steer more carefully in tight corners (helps with cars crashing into walls on Trento-Bondone, for example); 1 or 0
REMOVE_STEER_LOOKAHEAD_SPEED_LIMIT=0 ; Improve the way AIs turn at speeds above 200 km/h; 1 or 0
FIX_UPSHIFT_THRESHOLD=0 ; Fix upshift thresholds (might help AIs to drive cars made by people that don’t drive with AIs); 1 or 0; new

[RAIN]
; Rain awareness
AVOID_SIDES=1 ; Avoid sides when raining (prefer a trajectory closer to the middle of a track depending on how wet is the track); 1 or 0
AVOID_PUDDLES=0 ; Avoid puddles (look ahead and steer to avoid some of the deep puddles, experimental); 1 or 0

[AI_SPLINES]
; Extra options for AI splines
ALT_GRID=1 ; Use sparse grid (replaces original AC AI grid. Improves precision, performance, loading time and memory consumption. Original grid is still stored when recording AI lanes for now, for compatibility.); 1 or 0
CACHE_PAYLOADS=1 ; Cache generated payloads (might improve loading speed); 1 or 0
ALT_DRAG_SPLINE=1 ; Create parallel AI spline for AI cars starting from non-AI spot; 1 or 0
SAFE_NORMALS_RAYCASTING=0 ; Use safer approach for AI spline preparation (might help prevent crashes on some tracks where there is no physical surface below an AI spline); 1 or 0; new
EXPERIMENTAL_OPTIMIZATIONS= ; CLOSED_CHECK, INDEX_SEARCH, INDEX_SEARCH_CACHE ; hidden
LINEAR_METADATA_FOR_LARGE_SPLINES=1 ;; hidden
FIX_REVERSED=1 ; Fix direction (some uphill tracks have downhill counterparts which aren’t reversed appropriately, this tweak should help with that); 1 or 0; new

[WRONG_WAY]
; Allow to drive wrong way (offline only)
ALLOW_IN_PRACTICE=1 ; In Practice mode (not in weekends); 1 or 0
ALLOW_IN_TRACKDAY=1 ; In Track Day mode; 1 or 0

[RESET_CAR]
; hidden
; Allow to reset car (offline only, not in a race; invalidates lap)
RESET_DISTANCE=30
STEPBACK_DISTANCE=300

[AI_FLOOD]
; AI flood (works in Track Day mode)
ENABLED=1 ; Active; 1 or 0
DEBUG_MODE=0 ;; hidden
MIN_TRACK_LENGTH=7000 ; Minimum track length (there is no need to turn it on on short tracks, just looks silly); from 1000 m to 13000, round to 500
HIDE_DRIVER_NAMES=1 ;; 1 or 0
PREFERRED_TYRES=Street, Street?, Semislicks, HR, Slick Hard ;; hidden
PUSH_FORCE=100000 ; Push force (gets newly spawned AIs to get to speed faster, but might cause damage to cars and result in broken cars on the side of the road); from 0 N to 250000
PUSH_SPEED=80 ; Push speed (gets newly spawned AIs to get to speed faster, but might cause damage to cars and result in broken cars on the side of the road); from 0 km/h to 120
MIN_DISTANCE_TO_AI=15 ;; hidden
X_OFFSET_MULT=0 ;; hidden
Y_OFFSET=0 ;; hidden
SHUFFLE_BEHAVIOUR=AUTO ; Behavior variation (randomly limit throttle, speed, alter following distance for AIs on respawn to increase variety in behavior; in automatic mode would affect only multi-lane traffic maps); ALWAYS, AUTO, NEVER
SPEED_LIMIT=80, 160 ; Speed limit (only applied with active behavior variation); two values from 40 km/h to 240; not available with SHUFFLE_BEHAVIOUR:NEVER
SHUFFLE_COLORS=1 ;; 1 or 0

SPAWN_MIN_DISTANCE_TO_PLAYER=400, 200 ;; hidden

[AI_RACE_COOLDOWN]
; AI race cooldown lap
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0
LIMITER=0.2 ; Throttle limit ; from 0.1 to 1, perc.

[AI_RACE_RETIREMENT]
; AI retirement settings
REJOIN=0 ; Get back to the race after going to pits; 1 or 0
REJOIN_MESSAGE=0 ; Show message when AIs go back to pits; 1 or 0
PIT_WITH_DAMAGE=1 ; Go to pits if taken a lot of damage; 1 or 0
TELEPORT_WITH_DAMAGE=1 ; Teleport to pits if taken too much damage; 1 or 0

[AI_RACE_RUBBERBANDING]
; AI rubberbanding
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0
CHANGE_TIME=60 ; Time to apply; from 0 s to 300
CHANGE_DISTANCE=200 ; Distance to apply; from 0 m to 500
DECREASE_AHEAD=0.03 ; Decrease for cars ahead; from 0 to 0.2, perc.
INCREASE_BEHIND=0.1 ; Increase for cars behind; from 0 to 0.2, perc.
__HINT_BOTTOM=With rubberbanding cars behind would drive faster and cars in front would be slower (with AI level offset). Offsets grow from 0 to specified value based on how the time an AI car was ahead or behind (getting to full value at “time to apply”) and on how far is AI car from player (getting to full value at “distance to apply”).
