FULLNAME=Nice Screenshots
PREVIEW=https://acstuff.ru/images/modules/nice_screenshots.jpg
DESCRIPTION=Changes the algorithm AC uses to create screenshots, adding accumulation AA by taking several shots at once and blending them together. While at it, smooths out motion blur as well, and, if needed, allows to create somewhat acceptable super-resolution screenshots (works better without MSAA and with limited post-processing effects).
SHORT_DESCRIPTION=No more aliasing

; Extension
ENABLED=1 ; Active (set to 0 to disable Nice Screenshots extension); 1 or 0

[WINDOWS_IMAGING_COMPONENT]
; WIC encoder (WIC saves JPEG-images faster and with higher quality)
USE=1 ; Use WIC encoder; 1 or 0
QUALITY=99 ; JPEG quality; from 93% to 100, round
EXIF=1 ; Save with metadata; 1 or 0

[ACCUMULATION_AA]
; Accumulation AA (with which, several shots will be taken to get rid of aliasing)

ENABLED=1 ; Active; 1 or 0
DEBUG=0 ; Debug mode (dump all shots); hidden
ENABLED_FOR_THREE_MONITORS_SETUP=1 ; Active for three monitors setup; 1 or 0

; doesn’t work for now
ENABLED_IN_VR=0 ;; hidden

SAVE_ORIGINAL=0 ; Save original (if you want to compare the results); 1 or 0

; amount of samples to take
ITERATIONS=24 ;; From 4 to 80, round

; Don’t set it too high, videocards are no good at handling huge textures. And, scale
; ITERATIONS down: for example, with RESOLUTION_MULTIPLIER set to 2, there will be 
; four times more shots taken. Also, it might get weird with MSAA enabled, and doesn’t go
; well with PP-filters.
RESOLUTION_MULTIPLIER=1 ;; From 1x to 4, round

RANGE_MULT=1 ; Radius multiplier (how much within a pixel space will camera move; decrease it to make image sharper); from 0 to 1, perc.

; delay before saving, in seconds, to reduce overall lag
SAVE_DELAY=0.1 ; Delay before saving (helps to reduce overall lag); from 0 s to 0.5, round to 0.05

; extra sharpness
MIP_LOD_BIAS=-2 ; MIP LOD bias (for sharper textures); from -4 to 0, round
SHARPENING=0.05 ; Extra sharpening (using FidelityFX CAS by AMD); from 0 to 1, perc.

; for app
ROTATE_FOR_VERTICAL_ASPECT_RATIO=1 ; Rotate image if aspect in photo app is vertical (for higher resolution and better pixel coverage, sometimes can be blocked by other settings); 1 or 0

DISABLE_FLASHING=1 ; Disable flashing effect; 1 or 0

[BRIGHTNESS_BOOST]
; Brightness boost
BOOST=2 ; Boost intensity; from 0x to 10
EXPONENT=-1 ; Boost exponent (-1 for auto); hidden
__HINT_BOTTOM=Brightness boost improves fine details and helps to get proper DOF bokeh and motion blur light streaks. High values might decrease AA quality.<br><br>To get accumulated streaks like <url="https://files.acstuff.ru/shared/Hk7p/20211011-180830-spa-ks_nissan_gtr_gt3.jpg">these</url>, try really high boost (I used 1000 for that shot). Pro tip: to go outside of slider limits, click on a number and enter any number as large as you’d need.

[ACCUMULATION_SHADOWS]
; Accumulation sun shadows (blurs shadows with distance properly)
ENABLED=1 ; Active; 1 or 0; only with ACCUMULATION_AA/ENABLED
BLUR_STRENGTH=0.2 ; Blur strength; from 0 to 0.5, perc.

[ACCUMULATION_DOF]
; Accumulation DOF (replaces YEBIS DOF when making a screenshot)
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0; only with ACCUMULATION_AA/ENABLED
YEBIS_SHARE=0 ; YEBIS share (with 25% YEBIS would blur to 25% of its regular radius and accumulation DOF would go to 75% of its full radius; with 100%, accumulation DOF would be disabled); from 0 to 1, perc.
APERTURE_SIZE_MULT=1 ; Aperture size multiplier (base value is taken from PP filter); from 0 to 3, perc.
ITERATIONS_MULT=10 ; Multiplier for iterations; from 1x to 200, round to 0.5
EDGE_ACCENT=0.02 ; Edge accent; from -1 to 1, perc.
BLADES=6 ; Shape; from 3 blade(s) to 12, round to 1
BLADE_MULT=0.3 ; Shape strength; from 0 to 1.2, perc.
BLADE_OFFSET=0 ; Shape offset; from 0 to 1, perc.

[ACCUMULATION_BLUR]
; Accumulation motion blur (for replays)
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0; only with ACCUMULATION_AA/ENABLED
DISABLE_RIMS_BLUR=1 ; Disable AC rim blur; 1 or 0
SHUFFLE=0 ; Reduce banding with resolution multiplier active; 1 or 0; only with ACCUMULATION_AA/RESOLUTION_MULTIPLIER>1
TIME_MS=16 ; Shutter speed (for now, should be smaller than replay interval); from 2 ms to 32
ITERATIONS_MULT=3 ; Multiplier for iterations; from 1x to 9, round to 0.1
HDR_THRESHOLD=0 ; HDR fix threshold (use new brightness boost option instead); from 0 to 50, round to 0.1
HDR_EXPOSURE=0 ; HDR fix exposure (use new brightness boost option instead); from 0 to 5

[ACCUMULATION_INTERMEDIATE_SAVING]
; Accumulation intermediate saving
ENABLED=1 ; Active; 1 or 0; only with ACCUMULATION_AA/ENABLED
INTERVAL=30 ; Interval in seconds; hidden
__HINT_BOTTOM=If you’re making really long shots, to make sure at least something would be saved intermediate saving option would save your image every 30 seconds.
