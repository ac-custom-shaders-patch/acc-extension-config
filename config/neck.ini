FULLNAME=Neck FX
PREVIEW=https://acstuff.ru/images/modules/neck.jpg
DESCRIPTION=With this extension, camera looks at apexes, can follow steering and/or moving direction, has its shaking stabilized, tilts with G-forces, gets free look with right mouse button. For VR, there is a separate set of settings.
SHORT_DESCRIPTION=Alternative head motion
