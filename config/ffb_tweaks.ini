DESCRIPTION=A couple of FFB tweaks, more might be coming later.
SHORT_DESCRIPTION=A few FFB tweaks
; URL=https://trello.com/c/1DODnXHv/9-new-ai-behavior

[BASIC]
ENABLED=1 ; Active; 1 or 0

[TWEAKS]
; Miscellaneous tweaks
STRUT_FFB_ADJUSTMENT=1 ; MacPherson struct FFB adjustment (applied to a few rare cars with a certain unusual configuration for more accurate behaviour, wouldn’t affect Kunos cars); 1 or 0
FADE_IN_AFTER_LOADING=1 ; Disable FFB during loading; 1 or 0

[GYRO2]
; More physically accurate gyro implementation
ENABLED=0 ; Active; 1 or 0
STRENGTH=0.25 ; Strength; from 0.0 to 1.0, perc.
__HINT_BOTTOM=Optimal value for Assetto Corsa is 25%.

[POSTPROCESSING]
; Additional postprocessing
RANGE_COMPRESSION=1.0 ; Range compression (higher to compress force and make small forces easier to feel); from 0.5 to 4.0, perc.
RANGE_COMPRESSION_ASSIST=0 ; Automatically convert STEER_ASSIST into range compression on cars that use STEER_ASSIST; 1 or 0

[REAL_FEEL]
; Output real steering forces to wheel
ENABLED=0 ; Active (enables real steering forces for cars that include the required physics code); 1 or 0
WHEEL_MAX_NM=35.0 ; Wheel peak torque (use same value as your wheel’s peak torque); from 2.0 Nm to 35.0, round to 0.1
ENABLE_FOR_ALL=0 ; Override car setting (forces real-feel on, essentially disabling the power steering on a car not using extended physics); 1 or 0
__HINT_BOTTOM=Intended for Direct Drive Wheel users only.
