[LOOK_FOR_IMAGES]
; Where to look for backgrounds

; to find an appropriate screenshot, patch takes several steps, each 
; one of them could be skipped:

; first of all, look for those bcrN.jpg files in tracks’ ui folders.
; they’re quite nice, but, unfortunately, a rare occurance:

USE_KUNOS_SCREENSHOTS=1 ; Use Kunos images (those bcrN.jpg files in tracks’ ui folders); 1 or 0

; second, quickly check for screenshots in extension/backgrounds:

USE_EXTENSION_SCREENSHOTS=1 ; Use extension/backgrounds images; 1 or 0

; if you don’t rename AC screenshots and keep extension backgrounds accurately named, with this option, 
; you will always get correct image:

STRICT_SEARCH=1 ; (with this option, you can be sure you won’t see spa92 images if picked Spa racing track; however, it only works if you don’t rename your screenshots); 1 or 0

; if you have a separate folder where you’re keeping your best shots,
; that’s the place to set it:

FAVOURITE_SHOTS_LOCATION= ; Favourite images directory; dir

; third step, try to find a screenshot in that folder, made on that 
; track (filtering by file name).

USE_FAVOURITE_TRACK_SHOTS=1 ; Use track images from favourites; 1 or 0

; if not found, maybe look for some car shots?

USE_FAVOURITE_CAR_SHOTS=1 ; Use car images from favourites; 1 or 0

; if not found, use some random screenshot?

USE_FAVOURITE_RANDOM_SHOTS=0  ; Use random images from favourites; 1 or 0

; skip some shots

REGULAR_SHOTS_IGNORE_MASK=__custom_showroom_* ; Mask to ignore AC screenshots

; fourth step, look for regular screenshots, on that track:

USE_REGULAR_TRACK_SHOTS=1 ; Use track images from AC screenshots; 1 or 0

; with the same car:

USE_REGULAR_CAR_SHOTS=0 ; Use car images from AC screenshots; 1 or 0

; or just random:

USE_REGULAR_RANDOM_SHOTS=0 ; Use random images from AC screenshots; 1 or 0

; and, fifth step, simple fallback image:

FALLBACK_IMAGE= ; Fallback image; file (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png)

; if nothing found at all, it’ll go to AC logo, unless there are some files here:
FALLBACK_GRAPHICS=launcher\themes\default\graphics\bgr\pointcloud_bg*

; just to keep things fresh, probability which which, patch will fall to step further anyway:
FALLBACK_CHANCE=0.2 ;; from 0 to 1, perc
